# CAFE: Contemporary Apostolic Fathers Edition

Welcome to the CAFE repository! This project aims to provide a modern translation of the Apostolic Fathers' texts, filling a gap where openly licensed translations have become outdated. Our goal is to make these important early Christian writings more accessible to contemporary readers.

## Contents

This repository includes the following texts:

- 1 Clement
- 2 Clement
- Barnabas
- Didache
- Diognetus
- Ignatius of Antioch's letters:
  - To the Ephesians
  - To the Magnesians
  - To the Trallians
  - To the Romans
  - To the Philadelphians
  - To the Smyrnaeans
  - To Polycarp
- Polycarp's Letter to the Philippians
- The Martyrdom of Polycarp

## Translation Approach

Our translations aim to be clear, natural, and accurate. After many trials with a variety of models (I have experimented with Claude, Mixtral, Llama3, and Gemini), these first drafts were generated using GPT-4o. As a sanity check I have run semantic similarity tests across the translations and the original texts (LaBSE). The 15 most dissimilar lines did not warrant any particular attention, which is a promising sign. Apart from the challenge of LLMs being unreliable, though, translation is as much an art as it is a science. There are bound to be errors and areas worth improving in these translations, but having a starting point to build upon is a valuable first step and already makes these texts more accessible.

## Usage

Users can navigate the repository to find the texts they are interested in. The line numbering corresponds to the source texts available from the [Apostolic Fathers GitHub repository](https://github.com/jtauber/apostolic-fathers). Feel free to download, read, and use these translations for study, teaching, or personal enrichment.
