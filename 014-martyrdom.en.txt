0.1 The church of God residing in Smyrna to the church of God residing in Philomelium and to all the communities of the holy and universal church everywhere: May mercy, peace, and the love of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ be multiplied to you.
1.1 We wrote to you, brothers, about those who were martyred and the blessed Polycarp, who ended the persecution by sealing it with his testimony. Everything that happened before was so that the Lord could show us the true witness according to the gospel.
1.2 He waited to be handed over, just like the Lord, so that we too might be his followers, not only looking out for ourselves but also for others. For true and steadfast love means not only wanting to save oneself but also all the brothers.
2.1 All the martyrdoms that happened according to God's will are blessed and noble. For we must revere God more and entrust Him with authority over everything.
2.2 Who would not marvel at their bravery, patience, and dedication to the Master? Although beaten with whips until their veins and arteries were visible, they endured, making those who watched feel pity and sorrow. Some were so brave that they did not cry or groan, showing us all that at that moment they were suffering in the flesh but were with the Lord, who stood by them and spoke to them.
2.3 Relying on Christ's grace, they disregarded earthly tortures, buying eternal life at the cost of just one hour. The fire of their cruel torturers felt cold to them because they focused on escaping the eternal, unquenchable fire and looked with the eyes of their hearts at the good things promised to those who endure—things no ear has heard, no eye has seen, and no human mind can imagine. These were revealed to them by the Lord, for they were no longer just humans, but already angels.
2.4 Similarly, those condemned to the wild beasts endured terrible tortures, being stretched out on stakes and punished with various kinds of torture, so that if possible, the tyrant might force them to renounce their faith through persistent punishment. For the devil devised many schemes against them.
3.1 But thanks to God, their efforts were in vain against everyone. The courageous Germanicus strengthened their resolve through his endurance. He bravely fought the beasts. When the proconsul tried to persuade him by saying he should pity his own youth, he forcefully drew the beast to himself, eager to be freed sooner from their unjust and wicked lives.
3.2 Because of this, the whole crowd, amazed at the courage of the god-loving and God-fearing Christians, shouted, "Away with the atheists; find Polycarp."
4.1 But one man, named Quintus, a Phrygian who had recently come from Phrygia, became afraid when he saw the beasts. He had forced himself and some others to volunteer willingly. The proconsul, after much pleading, persuaded him to swear and sacrifice. Therefore, brothers, we do not praise those who give themselves up, because this is not what the gospel teaches.
5.1 But the admirable Polycarp, when he first heard it, was not disturbed and wanted to stay in the city. However, most persuaded him to leave. So he went out to a small estate not far from the city and stayed there with a few companions, doing nothing else night and day but praying for everyone and the churches throughout the world, which was his usual practice.
5.2 And while praying, three days before he was arrested, he had a vision and saw his pillow burning with fire. Turning to those with him, he said, "I must be burned alive."
6.1 As the searchers continued looking for him, he moved to another small estate, and soon the searchers arrived. Not finding him, they captured two young boys, and one of them, under torture, confessed.
6.2 It was impossible to hide him because those who betrayed him were from his own household. The police officer, who had the same name and was called Herod, was eager to bring him to the stadium so Polycarp could complete his destiny by becoming a martyr for Christ, while the traitors would face the punishment like Judas.
7.1 So, having the young boy, on Friday at dinner time, the searchers and soldiers came out with their usual weapons, running as if they were chasing a robber. Arriving late in the hour, they found him lying in an upstairs room. He could have left for another place from there, but he chose not to, saying, "Let God's will be done."
7.2 When he heard they were present, he came down and spoke with them. Those present marveled at his age and composure and wondered why there was such urgency to capture such an elderly man. He immediately ordered food and drink to be set before them at that hour, as much as they wanted, and he requested that they give him time to pray without fear.
7.3 With their permission, he stood and prayed, being so full of God's grace that he couldn't stop speaking for two hours. Those listening were amazed, and many regretted coming to arrest such a godly elder.
8.1 When he finally finished his prayer, having remembered everyone he had ever met, both small and great, famous and unknown, and the entire universal church, the time came for him to leave. They set him on a donkey and brought him to the city on the great Sabbath.
8.2 The peacekeeper Herod and his father Nicetes met him. They moved him onto a carriage and tried to persuade him, saying, "What's wrong with saying 'Lord Caesar' and offering incense to save your life?" At first, he didn't answer them, but when they kept insisting, he said, "I will not do what you advise me."
8.3 Failing to persuade him, they spoke harsh words to him and hurriedly pulled him down, causing his shin to scrape as he got off the carriage. Without turning back, as if he felt nothing, he eagerly and quickly walked on. They led him to the stadium, where the noise was so loud that no one could hear anything.
9.1 As Polycarp entered the stadium, a voice from heaven said, "Be strong, Polycarp, and be brave." No one saw who spoke, but our people who were there heard the voice. When he was brought forward, there was a great commotion among those who heard that Polycarp had been captured.
9.2 When he was brought forward, the proconsul asked if he was Polycarp. When he admitted it, the proconsul tried to persuade him to deny his faith, saying, "Respect your old age," and other things they usually said. "Swear by Caesar’s fortune, repent, and say, 'Away with the godless.'" But Polycarp, looking seriously at the whole crowd of lawless heathens in the stadium and waving his hand at them, sighed, looked up to heaven, and said, "Away with the godless."
9.3 The proconsul insisted, saying, "Swear, and I will release you; revile Christ." Polycarp replied, "For eighty-six years I have served Him, and He has done me no wrong. How can I blaspheme my King who saved me?"
10.1 When the proconsul persisted, saying, "Swear by Caesar’s fortune," Polycarp answered, "If you think I should swear by Caesar’s fortune as you suggest and pretend not to know who I am, listen clearly: I am a Christian. If you want to know about Christianity, set a day and listen."
10.2 The proconsul said, "Persuade the people." But Polycarp replied, "To you, I might have given a reason, for we have been taught to respect authorities and powers appointed by God, as long as it doesn't harm us. But those people, I do not consider them worthy of a defense."
11.1 The proconsul said, "I have wild beasts; I will throw you to them if you do not repent." But Polycarp replied, "Call them, for changing from better to worse is not repenting for us. It is good to move from harshness to righteousness."
11.2 The proconsul said to him again, "I will burn you with fire if you despise the wild beasts, unless you repent." Polycarp replied, "You threaten me with fire that burns for a short time and then goes out. You don't know about the fire of the coming judgment and eternal punishment reserved for the ungodly. But why delay? Bring whatever you wish."
12.1 While saying these and many other things, he was filled with courage and joy, and his face shone with grace. He was not troubled by the proconsul's threats, but instead, the proconsul was amazed. He even sent his herald to announce three times in the middle of the stadium, "Polycarp has confessed himself to be a Christian."
12.2 When the herald said this, the whole crowd of both Gentiles and Jews living in Smyrna shouted with unstoppable anger and loud voices: "This is the teacher of Asia, the father of the Christians, the destroyer of our gods, who teaches many not to sacrifice or worship." Saying these things, they kept shouting and asked the Asiarch Philip to release a lion on Polycarp. But he said it was not allowed, as the hunting games were over.
12.3 Then it seemed good to them to shout in unison that Polycarp should be burned alive. This was to fulfill the vision he had seen on his pillow, when he saw it burning and, turning to those with him, he prophetically said, "I must be burned alive."
13.1 So these things happened with such speed, faster than it was said, as the crowds immediately gathered wood and kindling from the workshops and baths, especially the Jews, who eagerly helped in this as was their custom.
13.2 When the fire was prepared, he removed all his clothes and tried to untie himself, though he had never done this before because each of the faithful was always eager to touch his skin first. For he was adorned with all good things for his just life even before his testimony.
13.3 So immediately they placed the instruments needed for the fire around him. When they were about to nail him as well, he said, "Leave me as I am. The one who gives me strength to endure the fire will enable me to remain unharmed without your nails."
14.1 But they did not nail him; instead, they tied him up. With his hands behind him and bound, like a prominent ram chosen from a great flock for an offering, a pleasing sacrifice prepared for God, he looked up to heaven and said, "Lord God Almighty, Father of your beloved and blessed Son, Jesus Christ, through whom we have received the knowledge of you, the God of angels and powers and all creation, and of the whole race of the righteous who live before you."
14.2 "I bless you because you have considered me worthy of this day and hour, to take a part in the number of the martyrs, in the cup of your Christ, for the resurrection to eternal life of both soul and body in the incorruptibility of the Holy Spirit. Among these, may I be received before you today as a rich and acceptable sacrifice, as you have prepared and revealed and fulfilled, you the unlying and true God."
14.3 "For this reason, I also praise you for everything, bless you, and glorify you through the eternal and heavenly High Priest, Jesus Christ, your beloved Son, through whom to you, with him and the Holy Spirit, be glory now and forevermore. Amen."
15.1 When he said "Amen" and finished his prayer, the men in charge of the fire lit it. A great flame blazed up, and we saw a miracle—those who were allowed to see it. We were kept safe to report what happened to the others.
15.2 The fire took the shape of an arch, like a ship’s sail filled with the wind, and surrounded the martyr's body. And in the middle, it wasn’t like burning flesh, but like baking bread or gold and silver being refined in a furnace. Indeed, we smelled such a sweet fragrance, like incense or other precious perfumes.
16.1 Seeing that the fire couldn't consume his body, the lawless men ordered an executioner to come and stab him with a dagger. When this was done, a dove flew out and a large amount of blood gushed forth, enough to put out the fire. The whole crowd was amazed, realizing the great difference between the wicked and the chosen ones.
16.2 One of these chosen ones was the most marvelous martyr, Polycarp, who in our times was an apostolic and prophetic teacher, the bishop of the church in Smyrna. Every word that came from his mouth has been accomplished and will be accomplished.
17.1 But the jealous, malicious, and wicked one, who opposes the righteous people, seeing the greatness of his martyrdom and his blameless life from the beginning, and crowned with the wreath of immortality with an undisputed prize, tried to ensure that even his body would not be taken by us, despite many desiring to do so and share in the holiness of his flesh.
17.2 So, Nicetes, the father of Herod and brother of Alce, was prompted to talk to the governor to prevent the body from being given to us. He said, "Don't let them leave the one who was crucified and start worshiping this one instead." The Jews also supported this idea and insisted on it, watching us because we wanted to take him from the fire. They didn't understand that we could never abandon Christ, who suffered for the salvation of the whole world, nor would we ever worship anyone else.
17.3 For we worship him as the Son of God, but we love the martyrs as disciples and followers of the Lord because of their unmatched devotion to their King and Teacher. May we also become companions and fellow disciples of theirs.
18.1 Seeing the argument among the Jews, the centurion placed him in the middle and burned him, as was their custom.
18.2 Later, we took up his bones, which are more valuable than precious stones and finer than gold, and we placed them where it was appropriate.
18.3 There, as much as we are able, we gather in joy and happiness, and the Lord allows us to celebrate the day of his martyrdom as a birthday, in memory of those who have fought before and for the training and preparation of those yet to come.
19.1 Such are the events concerning the blessed Polycarp, who, along with those from Philadelphia, was the twelfth to be martyred in Smyrna. He is remembered more than all the others, even spoken of by the non-Christians everywhere. He was not only a distinguished teacher but also an exceptional martyr, whose martyrdom everyone desires to imitate according to the gospel of Christ.
19.2 Through his patience, he overcame the unjust ruler and thus received the crown of immortality. Now, rejoicing with the apostles and all the righteous, he glorifies God the Father Almighty and blesses our Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior of our souls, the Guardian of our bodies, and the Shepherd of the universal church.
20.1 You have deemed it worthy to be informed in more detail about what happened, so we have briefly reported it through our brother Marcianus. After learning these things, send this letter to the brothers in other places, so that they too may glorify the Lord who selects his own servants.
20.2 To him who can bring us all into his heavenly kingdom by his grace and gift through his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ, be glory, honor, power, and greatness forever. Greet all the saints. Those with us and Evaristus, who wrote this, greet you and your whole household.
21.1 The blessed Polycarp was martyred on the second day of the month Xanthicus, seven days before the Kalends of March, on a great Sabbath day, at the eighth hour. He was arrested by Herod, during the high priesthood of Philip of Tralles, when Statius Quadratus was the proconsul, and while Jesus Christ, who reigns forever, was the eternal King. To Him be glory, honor, greatness, and an eternal throne from generation to generation. Amen.
22.1 We pray that you are well, brothers, walking according to the gospel of Jesus Christ, with whom be glory to God, the Father, and the Holy Spirit, for the salvation of the holy elect, as the blessed Polycarp testified. May we be found following his footsteps in the kingdom of Jesus Christ.
22.2 These things were copied by Gaius from the writings of Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp, who also lived alongside Irenaeus. I, Socrates, wrote this in Corinth from the copies of Gaius. Grace be with you all.
22.3 And I, Pionius, wrote this again after searching out the previous writings, as revealed to me by the blessed Polycarp, as I shall explain further, gathering these almost faded records from the past, so that the Lord Jesus Christ may gather me with His elect into His heavenly kingdom, to whom be the glory with the Father and the Holy Spirit forever and ever. Amen.
EP.0 Another Epilogue Copied from the Moscow Manuscript
EP.1 Gaius copied these things from the writings of Irenaeus, who lived with Irenaeus, the disciple of Saint Polycarp.
EP.2 For Irenaeus, being in Rome at the time of Bishop Polycarp's martyrdom, taught many people. He is known for many beautiful and correct writings, where he mentions Polycarp, saying he learned from him, effectively refuting all heresies and passing down the ecclesiastic and universal rule, as received from the saint.
EP.3 He also says this: That once when Polycarp met Marcion, from whom the so-called Marcionites come, and Marcion said, "Do you recognize us, Polycarp?" Polycarp replied to Marcion, "I recognize, I recognize the firstborn of Satan."
EP.4 It is also mentioned in Irenaeus's writings that on the day and at the hour when Polycarp was martyred in Smyrna, Irenaeus, who was in the city of Rome, heard a voice like a trumpet saying, "Polycarp has been martyred."
EP.5 So, as mentioned before, Gaius copied these writings of Irenaeus. Then, Isocrates copied from Gaius's copies in Corinth. And I, Pionius, after searching for these writings, copied them from Isocrates's copies according to a revelation from Saint Polycarp, bringing them together when they were almost lost with time. May the Lord Jesus Christ gather me with His chosen ones into His heavenly kingdom. To Him be the glory with the Father and the Holy Spirit forever and ever. Amen.
