0.1 Ignatius, also called Theophorus, to Polycarp, bishop of the church in Smyrna, but more so overseen by God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, sends many greetings.
1.1 Recognizing your God-given wisdom, established like an unshakeable rock, I greatly rejoice, having been deemed worthy of your blameless presence, from which I benefit in God.
1.2 I urge you, by the grace that you wear, to continue in your path and encourage everyone, so that they may be saved. Look after your position with all care, both physically and spiritually. Strive for unity, which is the best. Bear with everyone, as the Lord does you; endure all in love, as you already do.
1.3 Devote yourself to unceasing prayers; ask for more wisdom than you already have; stay alert, keeping a vigilant spirit. Speak to each person with good will, as God does. Bear everyone's weaknesses like a perfect athlete. Where there is more effort, there is much gain.
2.1 If you love good students, there is no credit to you; rather, gently bring the more troublesome ones into line. Not every wound is healed with the same dressing. Calm irritations with gentle rain.
2.2 Be wise as a serpent in all things and always innocent as a dove. Therefore, be both physical and spiritual, so you can deal kindly with what is seen and ask for the unseen to be revealed to you. This way, you will lack nothing and have an abundance of every gift.
2.3 The moment demands you, like a captain facing the winds and a storm-tossed ship seeking a harbor, to reach God. Stay sober, like an athlete of God; the goal is immortality and eternal life, which you believe in. I am your support in everything, and my bonds that you loved.
3.1 Do not be shaken by those who seem trustworthy but teach differently. Stand firm like an anvil struck by hammers. It is the mark of a great athlete to take blows and win. Above all, we must endure everything for God's sake, so that He will also endure us.
3.2 Become more diligent than you are. Understand the times. Await the one beyond time, the unseen, who became visible for us, the untouchable, who experienced suffering for us, enduring everything in every way for our sake.
4.1 Do not neglect the widows; after the Lord, you should be their caretaker. Let nothing be done without your consent, and do nothing without God, which you already do; stand firm.
4.2 Let the gatherings happen more frequently; ask for everyone by name.
4.3 Do not be arrogant towards male and female slaves; let them not be prideful either, but serve even more for God's glory, so that they may receive a better freedom from God. They should not long to be freed by human means, so they do not become slaves to desire.
5.1 Avoid sinful behaviors; instead, talk about these things. Speak to my sisters to love the Lord and be content with their husbands in both body and spirit. Likewise, tell my brothers in the name of Jesus Christ to love their wives as the Lord loves the church.
5.2 If anyone can remain pure to honor the Lord's body, let them do so without boasting. If they boast, they are lost, and if everyone knows about it more than the bishop, they are ruined. Those getting married should do so with the bishop's approval, so the marriage is in the Lord and not out of desire. Let everything be done to honor God.
6.1 Pay attention to the bishop, so that God will also pay attention to you. I give my life for those who follow the bishop, elders, and deacons; may I share in God with them. Work hard together, compete together, run together, suffer together, sleep together, and rise together as God's stewards, companions, and servants.
6.2 Please the one you serve, from whom you receive your rewards; let none of you be found a deserter. Let your baptism be like your weapons, your faith like a helmet, your love like a spear, and your patience like armor. Use your works as investments so that you may receive worthy returns. Be patient with one another in gentleness, as God is with you. May I benefit from you always.
7.1 Since the church in Antioch, Syria is at peace, as I have been told because of your prayers, I have become more cheerful and carefree in God. If I suffer for God, I hope to be found in your resurrection as a disciple.
7.2 Polycarp, most blessed by God, it is fitting for you to hold a divine council and appoint someone you love dearly and who is tireless, someone who can be called a servant of God. Consider sending this person to Syria to honor your tireless love for the glory of God.
7.3 A Christian does not belong to themselves but is dedicated to God. This is God's work and yours when you complete it. I believe by grace that you are ready to do good as belongs to God. Knowing your commitment to the truth, I have encouraged you with this brief letter.
8.1 Since I was not able to write to all the churches because I had to set sail suddenly from Troas to Neapolis, as was needed, please write to the churches ahead, as you know God's will, so that they can do the same. Some may send people on foot, and others may send letters through those you dispatch, so that you may be glorified in this eternal work, as you deserve.
8.2 I send greetings to everyone by name, including the family and children of the caretaker. I greet my dear Attalus. I greet the one who is about to be honored with the journey to Syria. May grace always be with them and with Polycarp, who is sending them.
8.3 I pray that you may always be strong in our God, Jesus Christ, in whom you should remain united with God and the bishop. I send greetings to Alcaeus, the dear name to me. Farewell in the Lord.
