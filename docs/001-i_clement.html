      <h3 class="chapter_ref">Ⅰ</h3>
Due to the sudden and consecutive misfortunes and incidents that happened to us, we think we were delayed in addressing your requests, dear ones, regarding the improper and foreign rebellion to the chosen of God, an impure and unholy division which a few reckless and arrogant individuals have kindled to such a degree of madness that your honorable and renowned name, loved by all people, has been greatly slandered.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Who, visiting you, did not praise your virtuous and steadfast faith? Who did not admire your sensible and gentle piety in Christ? Who did not proclaim the grandeur of your hospitality? And who did not bless your perfect and unwavering knowledge?
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;For you did everything without favoritism and walked according to the laws of God, submitting to your leaders and giving the proper respect to the elders among you. You allowed the young to think moderately and reverently. You instructed women to perform all duties with blameless, dignified, and pure conscience, appropriately loving their husbands. You taught them to be within the rule of submission, managing their households with dignity and self-control.
    </div>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 class="chapter_ref">Ⅱ</h3>
You all acted humbly, without boasting, preferring to be submissive rather than to dominate, giving more gladly than receiving. You were content with what Christ provided and paid careful attention to His words, holding them close to your hearts, and His sufferings were always before your eyes.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;In this way, deep and rich peace was given to all, along with an insatiable desire to do good, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit came upon everyone.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Filled with holy intentions, with good eagerness and reverent confidence, you stretched out your hands to almighty God, pleading with Him to be merciful if you had unknowingly sinned.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;Day and night, you struggled for the whole community, hoping that with mercy and a clear conscience, the number of His chosen ones would be saved.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;You were sincere, pure, and forgiving towards one another.
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;All conflict and division were hateful to you. You mourned your neighbor's mistakes and saw their shortcomings as your own.
      <span class="verse_ref">7</span>&nbsp;You never regretted any good deed and were always ready for every good work.
      <span class="verse_ref">8</span>&nbsp;Adorned with virtuous and respectful conduct, you did everything with reverence. The Lord's commands and laws were written deep in your hearts.
    </div>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 class="chapter_ref">Ⅲ</h3>
All glory and greatness were given to you, and what was written was fulfilled: You ate, drank, grew wide and fat, and then you kicked away the beloved.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;From this came jealousy and envy, quarrels and division, persecution and disorder, war and captivity.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Thus, the dishonorable rose against the honorable, the inglorious against the glorious, the foolish against the wise, and the young against the old.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;Because of this, justice and peace are far away, as everyone has abandoned the fear of God and their faith has weakened. They no longer follow His commandments or live as they should for Christ, but each follows the desires of their own wicked heart, taking up unjust and irreverent jealousy, through which death entered the world.

For it is written thus: After some days, Cain brought an offering to God from the fruits of the ground, and Abel also brought an offering from the firstborn of his flock and from their fat portions.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;And God looked with favor upon Abel and his offering, but He did not look with favor upon Cain and his offerings.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;And Cain was very upset, and his face fell.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;And God said to Cain, "Why are you so upset, and why has your face fallen? If you do what is right, won't you be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door."
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;Calm down; its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;And Cain said to Abel, his brother, "Let's go out to the field." And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
      <span class="verse_ref">7</span>&nbsp;See, brothers, jealousy and envy led to brother killing brother.
      <span class="verse_ref">8</span>&nbsp;Because of jealousy, our father Jacob fled from his brother Esau.
      <span class="verse_ref">9</span>&nbsp;Jealousy made Joseph be chased to the point of death and sold into slavery.
      <span class="verse_ref">10</span>&nbsp;Jealousy forced Moses to flee from Pharaoh, king of Egypt, when he heard someone of his own people say, "Who made you a judge over us? Do you want to kill me like you killed the Egyptian yesterday?"
      <span class="verse_ref">11</span>&nbsp;Because of jealousy, Aaron and Miriam camped outside the camp.
      <span class="verse_ref">12</span>&nbsp;Jealousy brought Dathan and Abiram alive down to the underworld because they rebelled against God's servant Moses.
      <span class="verse_ref">13</span>&nbsp;Because of jealousy, David was envied not only by foreigners, but he was also chased by Saul, the king of Israel.

But to stop with the ancient examples, let's consider the athletes who lived closer to our time: let's take the noble examples from our own generation.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Because of jealousy and envy, the greatest and most righteous pillars were persecuted and struggled even to the point of death.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Let's keep before our eyes the good apostles.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;Peter, who because of unjust jealousy endured not just one or two, but many hardships, and having testified, went to the deserved place of glory.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;Because of jealousy and strife, Paul showed the prize of endurance.
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;He was imprisoned seven times, exiled, stoned, and became a preacher in both the East and the West. He received the glorious fame of his brave faith.
      <span class="verse_ref">7</span>&nbsp;He taught righteousness to the whole world, went to the farthest point of the West, and witnessed in front of rulers. In this way, he left the world and was taken up to the holy place, becoming the greatest example of endurance.

A great number of chosen people gathered around these men who lived holy lives. Suffering many tortures and pains out of zeal, they became the best example for us.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Women like the Danaids and Dircae, persecuted out of zeal, suffered terrible and cruel tortures. Yet, they reached the steadfast path of faith and received a noble reward, though weak in body.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Zeal separated wives from their husbands and changed what our father Adam said: "This now is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh."
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;Zeal and strife have destroyed great cities and uprooted mighty nations.

Beloved, we send you these reminders not just to advise you but also to remind ourselves, for we are in the same race, and the same struggle lies ahead for us.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;So let us abandon empty and useless concerns, and turn to the glorious and honorable tradition that guides us.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;And let us see what is good, what is pleasing, and what is acceptable before the One who made us.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;Let us look to the blood of Christ and understand how precious it is to His Father, for it was shed for our salvation and brought the gift of repentance to the whole world.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;Let us go through all the generations and see that in every generation, the Lord has given a place for repentance to those who wish to return to Him.
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;Noah preached repentance, and those who listened were saved.
      <span class="verse_ref">7</span>&nbsp;Jonah preached destruction to the Ninevites; but those who repented of their sins prayed to God and received salvation, even though they were strangers to God.
    </div>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 class="chapter_ref">Ⅷ</h3>
The ministers of God's grace spoke about repentance through the Holy Spirit.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;And the Lord of all also spoke about repentance with an oath: "As I live," says the Lord, "I do not desire the death of the sinner, but rather that they repent," showing his goodwill.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;"Repent, house of Israel, from your sins," I said to the sons of my people. "Even if your sins stretch from the earth to the sky, and are redder than crimson and blacker than sackcloth, if you turn to me with all your heart and say, 'Father,' I will listen to you as to a holy people."
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;And in another place, it says: "Wash yourselves and become clean. Remove your wicked deeds from before my eyes; stop doing evil. Learn to do good, seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, and plead for the widow. Come now, let's settle this," says the Lord. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they will be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they will be like wool. If you are willing and listen to me, you will eat the good things of the land. But if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword," for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;So, wanting all his beloved to share in repentance, he supported them with his almighty will.

Therefore, let us obey His magnificent and glorious will, and become supplicants for His mercy and kindness. Let us fall before Him and turn to His compassion, abandoning our futile struggles, strife, and deadly jealousy.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Let us look to those who have completely served His magnificent glory.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Let us take Enoch, who was found righteous in obedience and was taken up, and his death was never found.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;Noah was found faithful and through his service proclaimed a new beginning for the world, and the Lord saved the animals that entered the ark in harmony through him.
    </div>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 class="chapter_ref">Ⅹ</h3>
Abraham, who was called a friend, was found faithful because he obeyed God's words.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;He obeyed and left his land, his relatives, and his father's house so that, leaving behind a small land, weak kin, and a modest house, he might inherit God's promises. For God said to him:
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;"Leave your land, your relatives, and your father's house to go to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation and bless you. I will make your name great, and you will be blessed. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you, and through you, all the families of the earth will be blessed."
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;And when he separated from Lot, God said to him: "Look up from where you are and see to the north, south, east, and west. All the land that you see, I will give to you and your descendants forever."
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;"I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your descendants could also be counted."
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;And again, God took Abraham outside and said to him, "Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them. So shall your descendants be." Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.
      <span class="verse_ref">7</span>&nbsp;Because of his faith and hospitality, he was given a son in his old age, and because of his obedience, he offered him as a sacrifice to God on the mountain that God showed him.
    </div>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 class="chapter_ref">Ⅺ</h3>
Because of his hospitality and piety, Lot was saved from Sodom when the whole surrounding area was judged with fire and sulfur. The Lord made it clear that He does not abandon those who trust in Him, but those who turn away are put to punishment and torment.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Because his wife went with him but had a different opinion and wasn't in agreement, she was turned into a pillar of salt as a sign. This happened so that everyone would know that those who are double-minded and doubt God's power are judged and serve as a warning for all generations.
    </div>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 class="chapter_ref">Ⅻ</h3>
Because of her faith and hospitality, Rahab the prostitute was saved.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;When Joshua son of Nun sent spies to Jericho, the king of the land found out that they had come to scout the country. So, he sent men to capture them so they could be put to death.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;So hospitable Rahab took them in and hid them on the roof under bundles of flax.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;When the king’s men came and said, "The spies who came to scout our land came to you. Bring them out, for this is what the king commands," she answered, "The men you are looking for did come to me, but they have already left and are on their way." She gave them a different direction.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;And she said to the men, "I know that the Lord is giving you this land. Fear and terror of you have fallen on its inhabitants. So when you take it, please save me and my father's household."
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;And they said to her, "It will be as you have said. When we come to take the city, gather all your family under your roof, and they will be saved. But anyone found outside the house will be killed."
      <span class="verse_ref">7</span>&nbsp;And they added, giving her a sign, that she should hang a red rope from her house, indicating that through the Lord's blood, there would be salvation for all who believe and trust in God.
      <span class="verse_ref">8</span>&nbsp;See, dear ones, that not only faith, but also prophecy was in the woman.
    </div>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 class="chapter_ref">ⅩⅢ</h3>
So let us be humble, brothers, putting aside all arrogance, pride, foolishness, and anger, and do what is written. For the Holy Spirit says: Let not the wise boast in their wisdom, nor the strong in their strength, nor the rich in their wealth, but let those who boast boast in the Lord, seeking Him and doing justice and righteousness; especially remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, who taught kindness and patience.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;For He said: Show mercy, so that you may receive mercy; forgive, so that you may be forgiven; as you do, so it will be done to you; as you give, so it will be given to you; as you judge, so you will be judged; as you act kindly, so kindness will be shown to you; the measure you use will be the measure you receive.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Let us build ourselves up on this command and these instructions, to walk obedient to His holy words, being humble; for the Holy Word says:
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;Upon whom will I look, but upon the humble and quiet one who trembles at My words.
    </div>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 class="chapter_ref">ⅩⅣ</h3>
So it is right and holy, my brothers, for us to be more obedient to God rather than to follow leaders who are proud and cause disruption with their wicked jealousy.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;For we will suffer not just harm, but great danger, if we recklessly submit ourselves to the will of people who stir up strife and divisions, leading us away from what is good.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Let us treat each other with kindness and compassion, just as the one who made us shows us mercy and gentleness.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;For it is written: The kind will live on the earth, and the innocent will remain on it; but those who do wrong will be wiped off from it.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;And again it says: I saw a wicked man flourishing and rising high like the cedar trees of Lebanon; but I passed by, and he was gone; I looked for him, but he was nowhere to be found. Stay innocent and see what is right, for there is a future for the peaceful person.
    </div>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 class="chapter_ref">ⅩⅤ</h3>
Therefore, let us stick with those who live in peace with godliness, and not with those who seek peace with hypocrisy.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;For it says somewhere: This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;And again: With their mouth they bless, but with their heart they curse.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;And again it says: They loved him with their mouth and lied to him with their tongue, but their heart was not right with him, nor were they faithful to his covenant.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;Therefore let deceitful lips be silenced, those that speak lawlessness against the righteous. And again: May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips and the boasting tongue, those who say: "We will prevail with our tongue; our lips are our own; who is lord over us?"
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;Because of the suffering of the poor and the groaning of the needy, now I will arise, says the Lord; I will set them in safety.
      <span class="verse_ref">7</span>&nbsp;I will speak out boldly on their behalf.
    </div>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 class="chapter_ref">ⅩⅥ</h3>
For Christ is with the humble, not with those who lift themselves up over His flock.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;The scepter of God's majesty, the Lord Jesus Christ, did not come in the boasting of arrogance or pride, even though He could, but in humility, as the Holy Spirit spoke about Him; for it says:
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Lord, who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? We proclaimed Him before others, like a child, like a root in dry ground; He had no majesty or beauty, and we saw Him, yet He had no form or splendor, but His appearance was humble, lacking the looks of people; a man suffering and in pain, knowing how to endure sickness, for His face was turned away, He was despised and not esteemed.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;He carries our sins and suffers for us, and we thought He was in pain, afflicted, and troubled.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;But He was wounded for our sins and crushed for our wrongdoings. The punishment that brought us peace was on Him; by His wounds, we are healed.
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;We all went astray like sheep, each of us turned to our own way.
      <span class="verse_ref">7</span>&nbsp;And the Lord handed Him over for our sins, and though He was mistreated, He did not open His mouth. Like a sheep led to the slaughter, and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, He did not open His mouth. In His humiliation, His justice was taken away.
      <span class="verse_ref">8</span>&nbsp;Who can speak of His descendants? For His life was taken from the earth.
      <span class="verse_ref">9</span>&nbsp;Because of my people's sins, He has come to death.
      <span class="verse_ref">10</span>&nbsp;I will give the wicked instead of His burial and the rich instead of His death, because He did no wrong, and no deceit was found in His mouth. The Lord wants to cleanse Him from His wound.
      <span class="verse_ref">11</span>&nbsp;If you offer for sin, your soul will see long-lasting descendants.
      <span class="verse_ref">12</span>&nbsp;And the Lord wants to remove the pain from His soul, to show Him light and fill Him with understanding, to justify the righteous one who serves many well. He will bear their sins.
      <span class="verse_ref">13</span>&nbsp;Therefore, He will inherit many and divide the spoils with the strong, because He gave His life to death and was counted with the lawless.
      <span class="verse_ref">14</span>&nbsp;He bore the sins of many and was handed over because of their sins.
      <span class="verse_ref">15</span>&nbsp;And again, He says: "I am a worm and not a man, a reproach of men and despised by the people."
      <span class="verse_ref">16</span>&nbsp;All who see me mock me; they speak with their lips and shake their heads: "He trusted in the Lord; let the Lord rescue him, let Him save him, since He delights in him."
      <span class="verse_ref">17</span>&nbsp;See, dear men, what example has been given to us: For if the Lord humbled Himself so much, what should we do, we who have come under the yoke of His grace through Him?

Let us be imitators of those who walked in goatskins and sheepskins, proclaiming the coming of Christ; we mean Elijah and Elisha, and also Ezekiel, the prophets; and in addition to them, those who endured witness.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Abraham was greatly honored and was called a friend of God, and looking at the glory of God in humility, he said, "I am but dust and ashes."
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;And also, it is written about Job: "Job was righteous and blameless, truthful, God-fearing, and avoiding all evil."
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;But he accuses himself, saying, "No one is free from impurity, not even if their life is just one day."
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;Moses was called faithful in all his house, and through his service, God judged Egypt with plagues and afflictions. But even though he was greatly glorified, he did not boast; instead, he said at the burning bush when he was given his mission, "Who am I that you send me? I am slow of speech and tongue."
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;And again he says, “I am but steam from a pot.”

What shall we say about the well-known David? Of him, God said, “I have found a man after my own heart, David, the son of Jesse; with eternal mercy, I have anointed him.”
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;But he also says to God, “Have mercy on me, O God, according to your great mercy, and according to your abundant compassion, erase my wrongdoing.”
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Wash me thoroughly from my wrongdoing, and cleanse me from my sin. For I know my wrongdoing, and my sin is always before me.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;Against you alone have I sinned, and I have done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and triumph when you judge.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;Behold, I was born in wrongdoing, and my mother conceived me in sin.
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;Behold, you desired truth in the inward being; you taught me wisdom in the secret heart.

      <span class="verse_ref">12</span>&nbsp;Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.
      <span class="verse_ref">13</span>&nbsp;I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you.
      <span class="verse_ref">14</span>&nbsp;Deliver me from bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation.
      <span class="verse_ref">15</span>&nbsp;My tongue will sing of your righteousness. Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.
      <span class="verse_ref">16</span>&nbsp;For you do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
      <span class="verse_ref">17</span>&nbsp;The sacrifice pleasing to God is a broken spirit; a broken and humble heart, O God, you will not despise.

And our apostles knew through our Lord Jesus Christ that there would be disputes about leadership.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Therefore, having complete foreknowledge, they appointed the previously mentioned people, and gave instructions so that if they were to pass away, other tested and approved men would take over their ministry.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Those who were appointed by them or later by other reputable men with the approval of the entire church, and who served Christ's flock blamelessly, humbly, peacefully, and unselfishly for many years with good testimony from all, we do not think should rightfully be removed from their ministry.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;For it will be no small sin for us if we remove those who have served the gifts of the bishopric blamelessly and devoutly.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;Blessed are the elders who have gone before us and ended their lives fruitfully and perfectly, for they do not fear being moved from their established place.

Brothers, you are contentious and zealous about things that belong to salvation.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Immerse yourselves in the holy scriptures, the true ones, given through the Holy Spirit.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;You know that nothing unjust or false is written in them. You will not find righteous people rejected by holy men.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;Righteous people were persecuted, but by lawless men. They were imprisoned, but by unholy ones. They were stoned by wrongdoers. They were killed by those filled with wicked and unjust zeal.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;They endured these things nobly.
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;What shall we say, brothers? Daniel, who feared God, was thrown into a lions' den.
      <span class="verse_ref">7</span>&nbsp;Or Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael, who, serving the magnificent and glorious worship of the Most High, were thrown into the fiery furnace? Not at all. So who did these things? The hateful and wicked men, filled with such rage, that they tortured those who served God with holy and pure intentions, not knowing that the Most High is the protector and defender of those who serve Him with a clear conscience. To Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
      <span class="verse_ref">8</span>&nbsp;But those who endured with trust received glory and honor, and their names were recorded by God in His memory forever and ever. Amen.

So, brothers, we also must hold fast to such examples.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;For it is written: "Stay close to the holy ones, because those who stay close to them will become holy."
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;And again, in another place it says: "With an innocent man, you will be innocent, with the chosen, you will be chosen, and with a crooked person, you will become crooked."
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;So, let's stick with innocent and righteous people; they are chosen by God.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;Why are there arguments, anger, divisions, and fights among you?
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;Don't we all have one God, one Christ, one Spirit of grace poured out on us, and one calling in Christ?
      <span class="verse_ref">7</span>&nbsp;Why do we tear apart and divide the members of Christ and fight against our own body? Why do we become so foolish that we forget we are members of each other? Remember the words of the Lord Jesus.
      <span class="verse_ref">8</span>&nbsp;He said, "Woe to that person! It would have been better if they had never been born than to cause one of my chosen ones to stumble. It would be better for them to have a millstone put around their neck and be thrown into the sea than to lead one of my chosen ones astray."
      <span class="verse_ref">9</span>&nbsp;Your division has led many astray, caused many to lose heart, and made many doubtful. It has brought all of us sorrow, and your conflict is persistent.

Take up the letter of the blessed Apostle Paul.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;What did he first write to you at the beginning of the gospel?
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Truly, he wrote to you about himself, about Peter, and about Apollos because even then you were forming divisions.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;But that division brought you a lesser sin because you were divided in favor of apostles with proven testimony and a man approved by them.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;But now, consider who has led you astray and lessened the dignity of your renowned brotherly love.
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;It is shameful, dear ones, and very shameful, and unworthy of your conduct in Christ, to hear that the stable and ancient church of the Corinthians is divided because of one or two people arguing with the elders.
      <span class="verse_ref">7</span>&nbsp;And this news has reached not only us, but also those who are not among us, causing slanders against the Lord's name because of your foolishness, and bringing danger upon yourselves.

Let us quickly remove this issue and fall before the Lord, weeping and pleading with Him, so that He, being merciful, may reconcile with us and restore us to the pure and honorable way of brotherly love.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;For the gate of righteousness is open to life, just as it is written: "Open for me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter through them and give thanks to the Lord."
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous will enter through it.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;So, of the many gates that are open, the one of righteousness is the gate in Christ. Blessed are all who enter it and direct their path in holiness and righteousness, accomplishing everything peacefully.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;Let someone be faithful, let them be able to speak knowledge, let them be wise in judging words, let them be pure in deeds.
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;The more someone seems to be great, the more they ought to be humble, and seek the good of everyone, not just their own.

The one who has love in Christ should follow Christ's commandments.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Who can explain the bond of God's love?
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Who is able to describe the greatness of His beauty?
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;The height to which love raises us is beyond description.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;Love binds us to God; love covers a multitude of sins; love endures everything, is patient with everything. There is nothing harsh in love, nothing proud. Love has no divisions, no quarrels. Love does everything in harmony. All of God's chosen ones have been made perfect in love. Without love, nothing is pleasing to God.
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;In love, the Lord accepted us. Because of His love for us, Jesus Christ, our Lord, gave His blood for us by God's will, and gave His flesh for our flesh, and His soul for our souls.

See, beloved, how great and wonderful love is, and its perfection cannot be explained.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Who can be found worthy of it except those whom God makes worthy? So let us pray and ask for His mercy, so that we may be found in love, without human bias, and blameless.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;All generations from Adam until this day have passed, but those perfected in love by God's grace have a place among the righteous, who will be revealed during the reign of Christ's kingdom.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;For it is written: "Enter into your rooms for a little while, until my anger and fury pass, and I will remember a good day, and I will raise you up from your graves."
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;We are blessed, beloved, if we follow God's commandments in harmony and love, so that our sins may be forgiven through love.
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;For it is written: "Blessed are those whose wrongdoings are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the person against whom the Lord will not count sin, and in whose mouth there is no deceit."

So then, for the times we have stumbled and done wrong due to the deceit of the enemy, let us ask to be forgiven. And those who have become leaders of rebellion and division must consider the shared hope.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;For those who live with fear and love would rather suffer harm themselves than harm their neighbors. Instead, they bring judgment upon themselves rather than disrupt the good and just unity handed down to us.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;For it is good for a person to confess their wrongdoings rather than harden their heart, like those who rebelled against God's servant Moses, whose judgment became clear.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;For they went down to the underworld alive, and death will shepherd them.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;Pharaoh and his army and all the leaders of Egypt, along with their chariots and riders, were not drowned in the Red Sea and destroyed for any other reason but because their foolish hearts were hardened after the signs and wonders were done in the land of Egypt by God's servant Moses.

Brothers, the Lord of all things needs nothing from anyone except to be confessed to.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;For the chosen David says: I will praise the Lord, and it will please Him more than a young bull with horns and hooves. Let the poor see and be glad.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;And again it says: Offer to God a sacrifice of praise and fulfill your vows to the Most High; call on me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver you, and you will honor me.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;For the sacrifice that pleases God is a broken spirit.

You know well the holy scriptures, dear ones, and have looked into the words of God. We write these things to remind you.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;When Moses went up the mountain and fasted for forty days and forty nights in humility, God said to him, "Go down quickly from here, because your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have sinned. They have quickly turned away from the path I commanded them and made for themselves an idol."
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;And the Lord said to him, "I have spoken to you once and again, saying: I have seen this people, and behold, they are stubborn. Let me destroy them, and I will erase their name from under heaven and make you into a great and marvelous nation, much greater than this one."
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;And Moses said, "No, Lord; forgive the sin of this people, or erase me from the book of the living."
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;Oh, what great love, what unsurpassable perfection. A servant speaks boldly to the Lord, asking for forgiveness for the people, or else to be erased along with them.

So who among you is brave, who is compassionate, who is filled with love?
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Let them say: If it is because of me that there is conflict and strife and division, I will step aside, I will go wherever you wish, and I will do what the people ask; only let the flock of Christ be at peace with the appointed elders.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Whoever does this will gain great honor in Christ, and every place will welcome them, for the earth and everything in it belongs to the Lord.

To give examples from other nations: Many kings and leaders, when faced with a plague, sacrificed themselves to save their people. Many left their own cities to prevent further conflict.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;We know many among us who have willingly gone to prison to free others. Many have sold themselves into slavery and used the money to feed others.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Many women, strengthened by the grace of God, have done many brave deeds.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;Blessed Judith, when the city was under siege, asked the elders to let her go out to the camp of the enemy.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;So, risking her own safety, she went out for the love of her country and her people who were under siege, and the Lord delivered Holofernes into the hands of a woman.
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;No less did Esther, perfect in her faith, risk herself to save the nation of Israel that was about to be destroyed. Through her fasting and humility, she earned the favor of the all-seeing Lord of the ages, who, seeing the humility of her soul, saved the people she risked her life for.

So let us also pray for those who have fallen into sin, that they may be granted kindness and humility to yield not to us but to the will of God. For in this way their memory before God and the saints will be fruitful and complete, filled with compassion.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Let us accept discipline, beloved, which no one should resent. The advice we give to one another is good and extremely beneficial because it unites us with the will of God.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;For thus says the holy scripture: "The Lord disciplined me, but he did not give me over to death."
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;For the Lord disciplines those he loves and punishes every child he accepts.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;For he says, "The righteous will correct me with mercy and rebuke me, but the oil of sinners will not anoint my head."
      <span class="verse_ref">6</span>&nbsp;And again it says: Blessed is the person whom the Lord corrects; do not reject the lesson of the Almighty, for he causes pain but also restores.
      <span class="verse_ref">7</span>&nbsp;He struck, but his hands healed.
      <span class="verse_ref">8</span>&nbsp;Six times he will rescue you from troubles, and in the seventh, no harm will touch you.
      <span class="verse_ref">9</span>&nbsp;In famine, he will save you from death, and in war, he will free you from the sword.
      <span class="verse_ref">10</span>&nbsp;He will protect you from the lash of the tongue, and you will not fear approaching trouble.
      <span class="verse_ref">11</span>&nbsp;You will laugh at those who do wrong and break the law, and you will not be afraid of wild animals.
      <span class="verse_ref">12</span>&nbsp;For wild animals will be at peace with you.
      <span class="verse_ref">13</span>&nbsp;Then you will know that your house will be at peace, and the place where you live will never fail.
      <span class="verse_ref">14</span>&nbsp;You will also know that your descendants will be many, and your children will be like the grass of the field.
      <span class="verse_ref">15</span>&nbsp;You will go to the grave like ripe wheat harvested at the right time, or like a stack of grain gathered in its season.

So you who started the rebellion, submit to the elders and learn to repent, bending the knees of your hearts.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Learn to submit, setting aside the arrogance and pride of your speech. It is better for you to be found small and worthy in Christ’s flock than to be cast out from His hope by thinking you are superior.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;For this is what all-good wisdom says: Look, I will share with you my words of breath, and I will teach you my speech.
      <span class="verse_ref">4</span>&nbsp;Because I called and you did not listen, and I spoke and you ignored, making my advice void and disobeying my corrections, therefore I will laugh at your downfall and rejoice when disaster comes to you, when destruction arrives like a storm, and when distress and trouble besiege you.
      <span class="verse_ref">5</span>&nbsp;For there will come a time when you will call on me, but I will not listen; you will seek me, but you will not find me. For you hated wisdom and did not choose to fear the Lord, nor did you want to follow my advice, but you mocked my corrections.
