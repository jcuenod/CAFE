    <div class="preamble">
Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the church of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ in Philadelphia of Asia, which has received mercy and is strengthened in the unity of God and rejoices without distinction in the suffering of our Lord and is filled with certainty in His resurrection in all grace. I greet you in the blood of Jesus Christ, which is eternal and lasting joy, especially if you are united with the bishop and the elders and deacons appointed according to the will of Jesus Christ, whom He has established firmly in His Holy Spirit.

I know this bishop did not gain his ministry by himself or through humans, nor for selfish reasons, but in the love of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I am amazed by his gentleness, as he, by being silent, accomplishes more than those who speak empty words.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;He is in harmony with the commandments like the strings of a harp. Therefore, my soul praises his mindset toward God, recognizing it as virtuous and perfect, his steadiness, and his calmness in all the gentleness of the living God.

So, children of the light of truth, avoid division and false teachings. Where the shepherd is, follow like sheep.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;For many deceitful wolves capture God's followers with evil pleasure; but in your unity, they will have no place.

Stay away from the wicked plants that Jesus Christ does not cultivate, because they are not planted by the Father. It’s not because I found division among you, but separation.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;For those who belong to God and Jesus Christ are with the bishop. And those who repent and join the unity of the church will also belong to God, so that they may live according to Jesus Christ.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;Do not be misled, my brothers; anyone who follows someone causing division will not inherit God's kingdom. Anyone who walks in someone else's opinion does not share in their suffering.

Make an effort to partake in one Eucharist; for there is one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup for the unity of His blood, one altar, and one bishop together with the elders and deacons, who are my fellow servants. This is so that whatever you do, you do according to God.

My brothers, I am overflowing with love for you and I am greatly joyful to ensure your safety. It is not me, but Jesus Christ, in whom I am bound, who makes me more fearful since I am still incomplete. But your prayers to God will complete me, so that I may attain the destiny in which I have received mercy, by committing myself to the gospel as to the flesh of Jesus, and to the apostles as the elders of the church.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;And let us love the prophets too, because they also proclaimed the gospel, hoped in Him, and awaited Him. By believing in Him, they were saved, united in Jesus Christ. These saints are worthy of love and admiration, testified by Jesus Christ and counted among those in the gospel of our shared hope.

If someone explains Judaism to you, do not listen to them. It is better to hear Christianity from a circumcised man than to hear Judaism from an uncircumcised one. But if neither speaks about Jesus Christ, they are like stone monuments and tombs of the dead to me, with only human names written on them.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;So avoid the tricks and traps of the ruler of this world, so that you don't get troubled in your mind and weakened in love. Instead, all of you should be united with an undivided heart.
      <span class="verse_ref">3</span>&nbsp;I thank my God that I have a clear conscience among you, and no one can boast secretly or openly that I have burdened anyone in small or large matters. And I pray that, in everything I have spoken, it will not become a testimony against them.

For even if some tried to lead me astray in the flesh, my spirit, which is from God, cannot be misled. It knows where it comes from and where it is going, and it reveals hidden things. I cried out while among you, speaking with a loud voice, with God's voice: Pay attention to the bishop, the elders, and the deacons.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Those who suspected me thought I was speaking about the division of some. But my witness, in whom I am bound, knows that I did not know this from human flesh. Instead, the Spirit proclaimed this, saying: Do nothing without the bishop, keep your body as a temple of God, love unity, avoid divisions, and be imitators of Jesus Christ, just as He is of His Father.

So I did my part as a person committed to unity. Where there is division and anger, God does not dwell. But the Lord forgives all who repent, if they turn back to the unity of God and the council of the bishop. I trust in the grace of Jesus Christ, who will free you from every bond.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;I urge you to do nothing out of selfish ambition, but according to the teachings of Christ. I heard some saying that unless they find it in the archives of the Gospel, they will not believe. When I told them that it is written, they replied that it is set before them. For me, the only archives are Jesus Christ, His untouched archives are His cross, His death, His resurrection, and the faith that comes through Him. In these, I wish to be justified through your prayers.

Priests are good, but better is the high priest entrusted with the holiest of holies, who alone knows the secrets of God. He is the door of the Father, through which Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the prophets, the apostles, and the church enter. All these things lead to the unity of God.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;The gospel has something special: the presence of our Savior, Lord Jesus Christ, His suffering, and His resurrection. The beloved prophets foretold Him, and the gospel is the completion of immortality. Everything together is good if you believe in love.

Because of your prayers and your love in Christ Jesus, it was reported to me that the church in Antioch of Syria is at peace. It is proper for you, as a church of God, to appoint a deacon to deliver God's message there, to rejoice with them and glorify His name.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;Blessed is he in Jesus Christ who will be worthy of such service, and you will be glorified. It is not impossible for you to do this for the name of God, just as the nearby churches have sent bishops, and some have sent elders and deacons.

Concerning Philo the deacon from Cilicia, a well-respected man who now serves me in the word of God along with Rheus Agathopodes, an excellent man who followed me from Syria, giving up his life; they testify on your behalf. I thank God for you because you received them as the Lord received you. May those who dishonored them be redeemed by the grace of Jesus Christ.
      <span class="verse_ref">2</span>&nbsp;The love of the brothers in Troas greets you. That's why I am writing to you through Burrus, who was sent to me by the Ephesians and Smyrnaeans to bring a message of honor. The Lord Jesus Christ, in whom they hope with body, soul, spirit, faith, love, and unity, will honor them. Stay strong in Christ Jesus, our shared hope.
